		<p> My name is Taylor Rosenbleeth! On March 25, 1997, a whopping 19 years ago, I was born in Dallas, Texas. For two years I lived with my two loving parents until we eventually moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina for a year. While living in this incredible city, I was able to welcome a new baby brother, Fletcher, who completed our family. Eventually, we moved back to the U.S., and life returned to normal. A few years down the road, the difficult choice of choosing where to go to college presented itself. My decision to attend the University of Georgia shocks many people because it is close to 900 miles away from home. The reason I chose to come here, however, is because I absolutely love the town, and it is a great school academically. Also, I have family that lives not too far down the road, so if I ever need anything, they are just a car ride away. In college, I have gotten involved in many activities and organizations, some of which include my sorority, UGA HEROs, UGA Alzheimerâ€™s Club, as well as several others. Next semester, I will apply to the Terry College of Business to be a Marketing Major, but for the time being I am trying to enjoy my days as a college student by having fun and working hard! </p>

		<h1> Life in Athens</h1>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p> My life here in Athens is <b>SO</b> much more fun than I ever could have imagined! I have made so many great friends through my sorority and have had countless exciting adventures. Some of my favorite memories include going to football games on Saturday (Go Dawgs!) and aimlessly wandering through downtown Athens with friends. There are so many things to do in Athens, that it is virtually impossible to be bored. Whether it be shopping, eating, or listening to live music, Athens, GA has something for everyone!</p>
		
		<p> Before you get too overwhelmed by all the options on the website linked below, I will tell you some of my favorite places around town. First things first, food! If you're in the mood for some great pizza, definitely check out Transmetroplitan or Mellow Mushroom. Feeling sushi? Try Shokitini. Mexican? Cali N Titos or Agua Linda are your best bets! My favorite shops are Impeccable Pig, Fringe, Urban Outfitters, and Entourage. Finally, my favorite places to listen to music are the Georgia Theater and the Foundry. </p>
